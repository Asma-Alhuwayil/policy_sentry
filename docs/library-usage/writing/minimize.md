Policy Minimization
===================

The documentation on policy minimization is relevant to this library content. That documentation can be found [here](https://policy-sentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing-policies/minimization/).

Note: The most relevant content from here is the `minimize_statement_actions` function.

Real-life usage of this function can be found in the `command.write_policy` module.
